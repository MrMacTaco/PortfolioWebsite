                <h3>Wave Breaker: VR</h3>
                <p>Wave Breaker was my final project for my Computer Science degree. I wanted to combine my love for tower defence games with the exciting world of virtual reality. Made entirely in Unity, Wave Breaker places the player right into the action of a traditional tower defence game. Armed with their trusty deployable turret, the player must make use of turret nodes and upgrades to survive agaisnt waves of enemies trying to reach the end of the course!</p>
                <p>In this demo, you can see the player building turrets and fighting off multiple waves of enemies. The source code for this project can be found <a href = "https://github.com/MrMacTaco/VrTowerDefense"> right here on GitHub!</a></p>
