          <h3>A Little About Myself</h3>
          <p>As you've probably already figured out, my name is Austin MacDougall! I'm a computer programmer whose passion for video games has extended well beyond just playing them. I've always been facinated with how games are made, which eventually led me down the path of completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Game Development at Acadia University.</p>
          <br>
          <p>While my skill set is primarily focused of the development of games, nothing excites me more than learning something new! Whether it be learning HTML to make the very site your looking at to something completely unrelated to coding, like photography, I love tackling new challenges!</p>
