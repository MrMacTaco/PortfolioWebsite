          <h3>What You Can Find</h3>
          <p> My goal for this website is to compile a series of projects that I've created into one easily accessible spot! For now, you can find some animations and coding projects I've worked on and as time goes on, I'll continue to update the content of this site!</p>

          <h3>What's Coming Up?</h3>
          <p>Currently, I'm working on teaching myself Blender and how to make animations! You'll likely see the animation section begining to fill up as I continue playing around with Blender! Ultimately, my goal is to learn enough about 3D modeling and animation to begin making assets for my next Unity project down the road!</p>
